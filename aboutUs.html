    <p> In 2004 Pizza Rocket was founded by a ex-rocket scientist, Alanda Rocket. Know teaching at California Institute of Technology. She found that near the campus there was not any good pizza delivery places near by which she felt was a crime as working were she does means lots of late nights doing research. In late 2004 after a long project was completed, she decided to open Rocket Pizza. After this day the success of the restraunt blew up faster then her sworn delivery causing the restraunt to quickly expand into one of the fastest and most populer pizza joints in the world. The success of the business far out matched her expectations earning them seven seperate awards for tast,speedy delivery and customer satisfation. So, as Alanda has said and countinues to provide, " A slice of good pizza can uplift even the darkest of days therefore we will not be the reason that the order to brighten your day cant come true, if its time that you as the customer are woried about well then ill just have to strap a rocket to it and get it there on time and hot. we are in the buisness of smilles and happy tummies not frowns and rouring stomics so i voe that no matter what your order will be as your should expect, fast, curtious, and always glad to do so"
      To this day the record is unbroken for expectations and now the drones are coming so hold on people, the rockets are getting strapped on! Dont forget to enjoy! Cheers!
